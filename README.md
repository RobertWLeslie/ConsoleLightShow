#- In order for the TTY gem to work, my current version of ruby needs to be
# downgraded from 2.6.1 to 2.5.0, or just wait until TTY works with 2.6.1
# (Which ever can come first, I'm writing this on a train to Newark with no
# #internet access so ayyy lmao)
# - Create method(s) that only prints out user specified colors

# - Module the hell out of this, because its getting to 200 lines of code and 
# there are certain functions that can be their own modules in a separate ruby
# file, because that looks nicer (and cooler, too!) than one VERY long .rb file.
